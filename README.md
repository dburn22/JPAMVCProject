### Who did the project?
This Create, Read, Update, Destroy (CRUD) project was designed, created, and coded by David Burnett, Greg Engler, Seth Thomas, and Will Roberts. The goal was to implement Gradle with the Spring tools IO IDE in order to develop a unique web application. This project not only illustrates all of our abilities to collaborate through communication and GIThub, but also competently design and build a full stack web application.

### What was the project?
The goal was to implement C.R.U.D. (Create, Read, Update, Delete), which is one of the most common types of behavior on the web. It represents the states of persistence that almost every web application has. The name of the web application was carefully named Frugal. The application was developed to allow new partners or married partners to begin the financial freedom journey through budgeting and understanding which partner is in charge of what bills. The application also always not only couples to understand the importance of budgeting, but also allows families to add children to the interface in order to keep track of chores.


### Technologies used:
Some of the technologies used in this project were session attributes, @Autowired annotations, as well as learning the latest capabilities of the Spring IO IDE. The team also utilized JPA and MVC project associated both with Gradle natures. Another key component of the project was learning about new dependencies in our persistence XMLâ€™s to pull in EntityManagers.

### What future feature sets you would like to add?
Some other features we would like to include in the project in the future would be allowing the user to edit more fields. We would also like to create a more user friendly version of the project while focusing on formatting using CSS and HTML.
